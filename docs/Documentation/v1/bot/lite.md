# Lite mode

The telegram bot always starts in lite mode allowing to create the first NFT fast.
You can [create a simple NFT](https://t.me/minanft_bot?start) in 2 steps:

- Enter the name of the NFT
- Upload or describe the picture

After minting the first NFT, the bot switches to the full mode.

You can always switch it back to the lite mode by choosing new from the menu
